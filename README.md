Car game using arrays

GRADE: 10/10

Using your code from the first Car assignment, redesign the program such that ten cars can be controlled
instead of just one. All the methods from before will remain the same, in terms of functionality. Additionally, we
are still dealing with a 20x20 grid that has strict bounds. All cars have the same attributes as the single car did
in the first Car assignment. Also, the error checking from before should still be in place.
